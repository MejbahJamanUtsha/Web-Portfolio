<p>i am mejbah jaman Utsha.i am a professional wed-developer. I can't explane myself in a single word.: In this lab, we were tasked with creating a bank database using SQL. The database included the following tables: branch, customer, account, loan, depositor, and borrower. We organized the tables based on parent-child relationships and established primary and foreign keys to maintain data integrity. </p>
